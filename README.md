# Treasure Hunt Game

What this project is:
This is a simple treasure hunt game that is played in a 10 by 10 grid set up.

Steps I took:
1) Create a 10 by 10 2D array of integers, each position initialised with integer 0.
2) In a random position in the array store the number 1.
3) Get the user to enter coordinates where they think the treasure is.
4) If the user guesses a position where there is a '1', return a "success, you have found the treasure!" message.
5) If not, repeat step 3 the above until they find the treasure.

*Task Extension: Add a feature to say 'hot', 'cold', 'warm' depending on how close their guess was to the actual hidden location.

How to use it: 
Feel free to run this game in any Python IDE or Replit.
