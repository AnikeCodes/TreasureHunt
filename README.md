Simple treasure hunt game in a 10 by 10 grid set up.
Task: create a 2D array of integers 10 by 10.
In a random position in the array store the number 1
Get the user to enter coordinates where they think the treasure is.
If there is a '1' at this position display "success."
Repeat the above until they find it.
